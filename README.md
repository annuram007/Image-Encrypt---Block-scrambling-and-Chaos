# Image-Encrypt---Block-scrambling-and-Chaos
A color image encryption technique using block scrambling and chaos - implemented using python
Overview
This project implements a color image encryption technique that leverages block scrambling and chaos theory to enhance the security of image data. The technique is designed to be robust, offering a strong defense against common cryptographic attacks while maintaining efficiency for practical applications.

Features
Block Scrambling: The image is divided into blocks, which are then scrambled according to a predefined or dynamically generated permutation matrix.
Chaos-Based Encryption: A chaotic map is used to generate pseudorandom sequences, which are then employed to further encrypt the scrambled image blocks.
Supports Various Image Formats: The encryption algorithm can be applied to images of different formats, including JPEG, PNG, and BMP.
Key Sensitivity: The encryption process is highly sensitive to the initial conditions and parameters of the chaotic system, ensuring that even slight variations in the key result in a significantly different encrypted image.
Decryption Support: The technique includes a decryption algorithm that accurately reconstructs the original image from its encrypted form when provided with the correct key.
Step 1: Block Scrambling
Step 2: Chaos-Based Encryption
Step 3: Decryption
